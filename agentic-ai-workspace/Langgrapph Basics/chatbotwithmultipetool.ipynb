       "\"Published: 2024-07-22\\nTitle: Attention Is All You Need But You Don't Need All Of It For Inference of Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Georgy Tyukin, Gbetondji J-S Dovonon, Jean Kaddour, Pasquale Minervini\\nSummary: The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving\\nmodels with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length\\ncomplexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-10-21\\nTitle: Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval\\nAuthors: Felix Michalak, Steven Abreu\\nSummary: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer\\narchitectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across\\nRecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic\\nretrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory\\nmechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to\\njust 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU\\nperformance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval\\ntasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle\\ntokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be\\navailable during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization\\nchallenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests\\nthese models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,\\nwith immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.\""

      "Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n",
