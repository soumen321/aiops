       "\"Published: 2024-07-22\\nTitle: Attention Is All You Need But You Don't Need All Of It For Inference of Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Georgy Tyukin, Gbetondji J-S Dovonon, Jean Kaddour, Pasquale Minervini\\nSummary: The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving\\nmodels with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length\\ncomplexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-10-21\\nTitle: Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval\\nAuthors: Felix Michalak, Steven Abreu\\nSummary: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer\\narchitectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across\\nRecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic\\nretrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory\\nmechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to\\njust 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU\\nperformance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval\\ntasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle\\ntokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be\\navailable during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization\\nchallenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests\\nthese models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,\\nwith immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.\""

      "Llama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\n",
      "decreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\n",
      "layers. For example, removing 33\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\n",
      "results in a 1.8\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\n",

In just a few years, AI has gone from struggling with basic comprehension to performing at near-expert levels. For example, early AI models would have struggled to pass a high school exam. Today, the latest models can score in the top percentiles on advanced tests like the SAT, LSAT, and even sections of the bar exam — achievements once thought to be beyond machines. [...] There are plenty of signs that AI is beginning to have a material effect on the world. One of the early signals may be the valuation of AI-related private companies such as OpenAI. Investors are willing to pay up for what they believe could be a potential leader in the field. The ChatGPT maker’s most recent funding round in the private markets valued the company at $300 billion. At current markets as of 3/3/25, this would place it as the 27th largest company in the S&P 500, a staggering [...] Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken center stage – not just in stock markets, but across economies and geopolitics. The current assimilation of the technology is astonishing, considering that the first widely available large language model (LLM), OpenAI’s ChatGPT, was released just over two years ago in November 2022.

      "Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n",
